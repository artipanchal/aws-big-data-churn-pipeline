Amazon SNS Notification Setup

Purpose:
Amazon SNS is used to notify the user about the status of the pipeline
execution (success or failure).

Steps:
1. Created an SNS topic named:
   telco-churn-pipeline-status

2. Subscribed an email endpoint to the topic.

3. Updated the pipeline shell script to publish messages to SNS
   after pipeline completion.

Example Notification Messages:

Success Message:
"Telco churn pipeline executed successfully at $(date)."

Failure Message:
"Telco churn pipeline failed at $(date). Please check logs."

Integration:
- SNS notifications are triggered automatically by the pipeline script.
- This ensures real-time monitoring without manual checks.
